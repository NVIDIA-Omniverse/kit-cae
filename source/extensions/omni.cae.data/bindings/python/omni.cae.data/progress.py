This module provides a simple way to provide status bar progress and activity
messages to the user.

Usage:

    from omni.cae.data import progress

    with progress.ProgressContext("Doing something") as pc:
        ... do 1/2 of something ...
        pc.notify(0.5)
        ... do 1/2 of something ...

It's also possible to nest contexts:

    with progress.ProgressContext("Doing something") as segment:
        count = 10
        for i in range(count):
            with progress.ProgressContext("Doing something %d of %d" % (i + 1, count), shift=i / count, scale=1.0 / count) as pc:
                ... do 1/2 of segment
                pc.notify(0.5)
                ... do 1/2 of segment

Thus, each segment can be shifted and scaled independently. Thus, when reporting progress for that segment of work,
we just need to report the progress within the range [0, 1] for that segment. The total progress will be
computed based on the sum of the progress of all segments in the stack.

`Segment.finish` should be called when you're done with the segment. It's not strictly necessary to call `Segment.finish`
for each segment, but it's a good practice. Destroying the segment will also call `Segment.finish` for you. This ensures
the stack survives exceptions, etc.
