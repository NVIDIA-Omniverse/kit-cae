# CAE VTK Importer [omni.cae.asset_importer.vtk]

This extension provides asset importer functionality for VTK files, integrating them into Omniverse through the standard import framework.

## Usage

Once this extension is loaded, VTK files can be imported using the standard `File > Import` dialog in Omniverse applications.
The importer processes VTK files and converts the data to USD format with appropriate CAE schema representations.
