# CAE NPZ Importer [omni.cae.asset_importer.npz]

This extension provides asset importer functionality for NumPy .npz files, integrating them into Omniverse through the standard import framework.

## Usage

Once this extension is loaded, .npz files can be imported using the standard `File > Import` dialog in Omniverse applications.
The importer processes numpy archives and converts the data to USD format with appropriate CAE schema representations.
